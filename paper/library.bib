abstract = {Advances in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems indicate a rapidly approaching future in which intelligent vehicles will automatically handle the process of driving. However, increasing the efficiency of today's transportation infrastructure will require intelligent traffic control mechanisms that work hand in hand with intelligent vehicles. To this end, Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control mechanism called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed in simulation that by studying the problem from a multiagent perspective, intersection control can be made more efficient than existing control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. We extend their study beyond the case of an individual intersection and examine the unique implications and abilities afforded by using AIM-based agents to control a network of interconnected intersections. We examine different navigation policies by which autonomous vehicles can dynamically alter their planned paths, observe an instance of Braess' paradox, and explore the new possibility of dynamically reversing the flow of traffic along lanes in response to minute-by-minute traffic conditions. Studying this multiagent system in simulation, we quantify the substantial improvements in efficiency imparted by these agent-based traffic control methods.},

The development of applications based on short-range devices in the European Community could also contribute to achieving specific Community policy goals, such as completion of the internal market, promotion of innovation and research, and development of the information society. (2) Short-range devices are typically massmarket and/or portable products which can easily be taken and used across borders; differences in spectrum access conditions therefore prevent their free movement, increase their production costs and create risks of harmful interference with other radio applications and services. In order to reap the benefits of the internal market for this type of device, to support the competitiveness of EU manufac-turing industry by increasing economies of scale and to lower costs for consumers, radio spectrum must therefore be made available in the Community on the basis of harmonised technical conditions.

However, contraflow lane reversal deployed in several cities are designed for specific traffic patterns at specific hours, and do not adapt to fluctuations in actual traffic. Motivated by recent advances in autonomous vehicle technology, we propose a framework for dynamic lane reversal in which the lane directionality is updated quickly and automatically in response to instantaneous traffic conditions recorded by traffic sensors. We analyze the conditions under which dynamic lane reversal is effective and propose an integer linear programming formulation and a bi-level programming formulation to compute the optimal lane reversal configuration that maximizes the traffic flow. In our experiments, active contraflow increases network efficiency by 72{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper describes the new facilities in the recently released Version 4 of the SCOOT urban area traffic control program. The new feature expected to interest traffic managers most is the on-line estimation of vehicle emissions of pollutants. These estimates are based on a mathematical model commissioned by the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR); the ASTRID database can store these estimates and allow the analysis of historical patterns of emissions. The chosen model is based on the following data: (1) the traffic flow on each link; (2) the mean speed on each link, averaged over all vehicles; (3) the proportions of four classes of vehicles on each link; and (4) distance travelled. Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulates (PM) are estimated, using emission-rate data in the form of a set of functions linking vehicle speed to emission rate. For each vehicle class and pollutant, the emission function is a given polynomial function of speed. Several enhancements have been made to SCOOT's cycle time optimiser, to increase its responsiveness to traffic conditions and to traffic managers' commands. New logic enables the use of information from existing stopline loop detectors. For the covering abstract, see IRRD E100187.},

They interpreted their results in terms of responses to analytical functions of relative speed divided by spacing, or spacing change divided by spacing. In the present paper the remits of a number of other field, simulator, and laboratory experiments to investigate sensitivity to relative motion reported in the literature are examined in the light of these analytical response functions. It is shown that this approach leads to a relatively consistent interpretation of most of the available data, and that, when appropriately interpreted, there is greater agreement between many of the experimental results than had hitherto been noted.},

Despite over 50 years of modelling, the precise mechanisms for the generation and propagation of stop-and-go waves and the associated spatio-temporal patterns are in dispute. However, the increasing availability of empirical datasets, such as those collected from motorway incident detection and automatic signalling system (MIDAS) inductance loops in the UK or the next-generation simulation trajectory data (NGSIM) project in the USA, means that we can expect to resolve these questions definitively in the next few years. This paper will survey the essence of the competing explanations of highway traffic pattern formation and introduce and analyse a new mechanism, based on dynamical systems theory and bistability, which can help resolve the conflict.},

abstract = {In recent years, the topic of car-following has become of increased importance in traffic engineering and safety research. Models of this phenomenon, which describe the interaction between (typically) adjacent vehicles in the same lane, now form the cornerstone for many important areas of research including (a) simulation modelling, where the car-following model (amongst others) controls the motion of the vehicles in the network, and (b) the functional definition of advanced vehicle control and safety systems (AVCSS), which are being introduced as a driver safety aid in an effort to mimic driver behaviour but remove human error. Despite the importance of this area however, no overview of the models availability and validity exists. It is the intent of this paper therefore to briefly assess the range of options available in the choice of car-following model, and assess just how far work has proceeded in our understanding of what, at times, would appear to be a simple process.},

A performance based benchmarking of these models might be useful to evaluate their capabilities in representing real driving behavior. Data precision is the key factor to make any such evaluation meaningful. RTK GPS is the latest technology in data acquisition that makes it possible to acquire high resolution vehicular movement data at an outstanding level of accuracy. Several car-following models were evaluated based on test track experiment data using a GA based optimization method. It was interesting to see a simple linear model performing better than some sophisticated models.},

abstract = {The continuous growth of road traffic volumes leads to significant environmental and economical problems. For this reason there have been efforts for more than four decades to understand the dynamics of traffic flow in order to find ways to optimize traffic with respect to a reduction of environmental impacts and economical losses due to congestion. In this work a microscopic model of traffic flow is proposed that adds to the understanding of the different types of congestion that are found in traffic flow. The main assumption the model is based on is the fact that in general vehicles move without colliding. From this property of vehicle motion a model can be derived that shows a rich dynamics and proves to be in good agreement with empirical data. The model is mainly characterized by the parameters describing typical acceleration and deceleration capabilities of the vehicles. It closely resembles other well-known models for certain choices of these parameters. By varying acceleration and deceleration capabilities a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the model and the previously known special cases is gained.},

abstract = {— In this paper we present a probabilistic framework for increasing online object detection performance when given a semantic 3D scene prior, which we apply to the task of traffic light detection for autonomous vehicles. Previous approaches to traffic light detection on autonomous vehicles have involved either precise knowledge of the relative 3D positions of the vehicle and the traffic light (requiring accurate and expen-sive mapping and localisation systems), or a classifier-based approach that searches for traffic lights in images (increasing the chance of false detections by searching all possible locations for traffic lights). We combine both approaches by explicitly incorporating both prior map and localisation uncertainty into a classifier-based object detection framework, generating a scale-space search region that only evaluates parts of the image likely to contain traffic lights, and weighting object detection scores by both the classifier score and the 3D occurrence prior distribution. We present results comparing a range of low-and high-cost localisation systems using over 30 km of data collected on an autonomous vehicle platform, demonstrating up to a 40{\%} improvement in detection precision over no prior information and 15{\%} improvement on unweighted detection scores. We demonstrate a 10x reduction in computation time compared to a nave whole-image classification approach by considering only locations and scales in the image within a confidence bound of the predicted traffic light location.

abstract = {Congestion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the transportation community; congestion accounted for an estimated {\$}87.2 billion in losses in 2007 alone. Transportation professionals need to go beyond capacity expansion projects and explore novel strategies to mitigate traffic congestion. Automated intersection management is a novel strategy that has the potential to greatly reduce intersection delay and improve safety. Although the implementation of such a system is contingent on the development of automated vehicles, competitions such as the Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency have shown that this technology is feasible and will be available. Therefore, the development of the infrastructure and associated control methods required to exploit fully the benefits of such technology at the system level is critical. This research explores one such innovative strategy, an automated intersection control protocol based on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) reservation system. The FCFS reservation system was shown to reduce intersection delay significantly by exploiting the features of autonomous vehicles. Microscopic simulation experimental results showed that the FCFS reservation system significantly outperformed a traditional traffic signal in reducing delay.},

@article{Ngoduy2013c,
abstract = {Abstract It has been widely reported in literature that a small perturbation in traffic flow such as a sudden deceleration of a vehicle could lead to the formation of traffic jams without a clear bottleneck. These traffic jams are usually related to instabilities in traffic flow. The applications of intelligent traffic systems are a potential solution to reduce the amplitude or to eliminate the formation of such traffic instabilities. A lot of research has been conducted to theoretically study the effect of intelligent vehicles, for example adaptive cruise control vehicles, using either computer simulation or analytical method. However, most current analytical research has only applied to single class traffic flow. To this end, the main topic of this paper is to perform a linear stability analysis to find the stability threshold of heterogeneous traffic flow using microscopic models, particularly the effect of intelligent vehicles on heterogeneous (or multi-class) traffic flow instabilities. The analytical results will show how intelligent vehicle percentages affect the stability of multi-class traffic flow. },

The research and development projects lasted over a period of almost 10 years and are an excellent example of cooperation between government and industry. TRRL has been investigating methods of providing traffic management facilities and has developed a new version of SCOOT, designated SCOOT 2. 3, with several features which give more flexibility. This new version of SCOOT contains additions to the offset and split optimisers which allow preference to be given to particular links relative to others in the network. This paper gives examples of the effect of link weighting as it exists in version 2. 3 of SCOOT and of how future versions may make use of link weighting to alleviate problems of congestion. In addition, examples are given of the uses of a research version of SCOOT to control severe congestion by the choice of special offsets and by the use of gating.},

abstract = {This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data – as commonly encountered in robotics applications – and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise},

abstract = {Looking ahead to the time when autonomous cars will be common, Dresner and Stone proposed a multiagent systems-based intersection control protocol called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM). They showed that by leveraging the capacities of autonomous vehicles it is possible to dramatically reduce the time wasted in traffic, and therefore also fuel consumption and air pollution. The proposed protocol, however, handles reservation requests one at a time and does not prioritize reservations according to their relative priorities and waiting times, causing potentially large inequalities in granting reservations. For example, at an intersection between a main street and an alley, vehicles from the alley can take an excessively long time to get reservations to enter the intersection, causing a waste of time and fuel. The same is true in a network of intersections, in which gridlock may occur and cause traffic congestion. In this paper, we introduce the batch processing of reservations in AIM to enforce liveness properties in intersections and analyze the conditions under which no vehicle will get stuck in traffic. Our experimental results show that our prioritizing schemes outperform previous intersection control protocols in unbalanced traffic.},

It is shown theoretically that the motion of a long line of vehicles becomes unstable when the product of the lag time and the proportionality constant exceeds one-half. The experimental data implies that driving is done on the verge of instability. A variety of other laws of following is analyzed theoretically.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have seen great advance- ments in recent years, and such vehicles are now closer than ever to being commercially available. The advent of driverless cars provides opportunities for optimizing traffic in ways not possible before. This paper introduces an open source multiagent microscopic traffic simulator called AORTA, which stands for Approximately Orchestrated Routing and Transporta- tion Analyzer, designed for optimizing autonomous traffic at a city-wide scale. AORTA creates scale simulations of the real world by generating maps using publicly available road data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This allows simulations to be set up through AORTA for a desired region anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. AORTA allows for traffic optimization by creating intelligent behaviors for individual driver agents and intersection policies to be followed by these agents. These behaviors and policies define how agents interact with one another, control when they cross intersections, and route agents to their destination. This paper demonstrates a simple application using AORTA through an experiment testing intersection policies at a city-wide scale. I.},

abstract = {The operation of traffic signals is currently limited by the data available from traditional point sensors. Point detectors can provide only limited vehicle information at a fixed location. The most advanced adaptive control strategies are often not implemented in the field because of their operational complexity and high-resolution detection requirements. However, a new initiative known as connected vehicles allows the wireless transmission of the positions, headings, and speeds of vehicles for use by the traffic controller. A new traffic control algorithm, the predictive microscopic simulation algorithm, which uses these new, more robust data, was developed. The decentralized, fully adaptive traffic control algorithm uses a rolling-horizon strategy in which the phasing is chosen to optimize an objective function over a 15-s period in the future. The objective function uses either delay only or a combination of delay, stops, and decelerations. To measure the objective function, the algorithm uses a microscopic simulation driven by present vehicle positions, headings, and speeds. The algorithm is relatively simple, does not require point detectors or signal-to-signal communication, and is completely responsive to immediate vehicle demands. To ensure drivers' privacy, the algorithm does not store individual or aggregate vehicle locations. Results from a simulation showed that the algorithm maintained or improved performance compared with that of a state-of-the-practice coordinated actuated timing plan optimized by Synchro at low and midlevel volumes, but that performance worsened under saturated and oversaturated conditions. Testing also showed that the algorithm had improved performance during periods of unexpected high demand and the ability to respond automatically to year-to-year growth without retiming.},

@article{Sheehan2013,
abstract = {This paper is about estimating a smooth, continuous-time trajectory of a vehicle relative to a prior 3D laser map. We pose the estimation problem as that of finding a sequence of Catmull-Rom splines which optimise the Kernelised R{\'{e}}nyi Distance (KRD) between the prior map and live measurements from a 3D laser sensor. Our approach treats the laser measurements as a continual stream of data from a smoothly moving vehicle.We side-step entirely the segmentation and feature matching problems incumbent in traditional point cloud matching algorithms, relying instead on a smooth and well behaved objective function. Importantly our approach admits the exploitation of sensors with modest sampling rates - sensors that take seconds to densely sample the workspace. We show how by appropriate use of the Improved Fast Gauss Transform we can reduce the order of the estimation problem from quadratic (straight forward application of the KRD) to linear. Although in this paper we use 3D laser, our approach is also applicable to vehicles using 2D laser sensing or dense stereo. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our approach when estimating the full 6DOF continuous time pose of a road vehicle undertaking over 2.7km of outdoor travel.},

In this paper, we present an online system for the augmentation of maps of outdoor urban environments with such higher-order, semantic labels. The system employs a shallow supervised classification hierarchy to classify scene attributes, consisting of a mixture of 2D/3D??geometric and visual scene information, into a range of different workspace classes. The union of classifier responses yields a rich, composite description of the local workspace. We present extensive experimental results, using two large urban data sets collected by our research platform. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of controlling an autonomous vehicle to arrive at a specific position on a road at a given time and velocity. This ability is particularly useful for a recently introduced autonomous intersection management protocol, called AIM, which has been shown to lead to lower delays than traffic signals and stop signs. Specifically, we introduce a setpoint scheduling algorithm for generating setpoints for the PID controllers for the brake and throttle actuators of an autonomous vehicle. The algorithm constructs a feasible setpoint schedule such that the vehicle arrives at the position at the correct time and velocity. Our experimental results show that the algorithm outperforms a heuristic-based setpoint scheduler that does not provide any guarantee about the arrival time and velocity.},

abstract = {Large scale exploration of the environment requires a constant time estimation engine. Bundle adjustment or pose relaxation do not fulfil these requirements as the number of parameters to solve grows with the size of the environment. We describe a relative simultaneous localisation and mapping system (RSLAM) for the constant-time estimation of structure and motion using a binocular stereo camera system as the sole sensor. Achieving robustness in the presence of difficult and changing lighting conditions and rapid motion requires careful engineering of the visual processing, and we describe a number of innovations which we show lead to high accuracy and robustness. In order to achieve real-time performance without placing severe limits on the size of the map that can be built, we use a topo-metric representation in terms of a sequence of relative locations. When combined with fast and reliable loop-closing, we mitigate the drift to obtain highly accurate global position estimates without any global minimisation. We discuss some of the issues that arise from using a relative representation, and evaluate our system on long sequences processed at a constant 30–45 Hz, obtaining precisions down to a few meters over distances of a few kilometres.},

This paper explores the possibility that auctions could be run at each intersection to determine the order in which drivers perform conflicting movements. While such a scheme would be infeasible for human drivers, autonomous vehicles are capable of quickly and seamlessly bidding on behalf of human passengers. Specifically, this paper investigates applying autonomous vehicle auctions at traditional intersections using stop signs and traffic signals, as well as to autonomous reservation protocols. This paper also addresses the issue of fairness by having a benevolent system agent bid to maintain a reasonable travel time for drivers with low budgets. An implementation of the mechanism in a microscopic simulator is presented, and experiments on city-scale maps are performed},

abstract = {This paper reports on the performance of signalised intersection control using vehicle GPS information compared to fixed-time and inductive loop based control. Traffic congestion forecasts estimate an increase of about 60{\%} in 2030. At present, poor choice of signal timings by isolated intersection controllers cause traffic delays that have enormous negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved by using vehicles' GPS information to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as traffic flow can be optimised and, hence, fuel consumption and emissions decreased. Under the open European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) framework, a traffic responsive GPS based vehicle actuation algorithm (GPS- VA) is proposed. GPS-VA uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection. The gathered information is then used to actuate intersection signal timings. Microscopic simulations comparing GPS-VA to fixed-time control and inductive loop based vehicle actuation (Loop-VA) on four urban road networks were performed to see how the proposed GPS-VA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies. The results show that GPS-VA is an effective alternative to traditional intersection control strategies, offering delay reductions of up to 50{\%} for connected vehicle fleet penetrations above 30{\%}.},

abstract = {In recent years, bus priority techniques for signals controlled by traffic management centers have become a viable alternative to reduce passenger delays at signalized intersections, especially in mixed traffic corridors. However, before any bus signal priority strategy is deployed in such corridors, the impacts on the different users of the system should be evaluated. The main objective of this work was to assess the operational performance of passive and active bus priority techniques in fixed and real-time signal systems of one of the main arterial corridors in Fortaleza, Brazil. As a secondary objective, it also evaluated the operational benefits of a SCOOT adaptive signal control system, comparing it with well-adjusted fixed-time plans optimized by TRANSYT, for periods of medium and high traffic volumes. In the evaluation of alternative scenarios, the following performance measures were considered: vehicle delay and number of stops simulated by SCOOT, as well as bus and automobile travel times observed in the field during the operation of each scenario. The results did not favor the adoption of passive and active priority schemes in the studied corridor; this led to the conclusion that SCOOT's real-time control, programmed for a good signal progression ofthe general traffic (buses and automobiles), is the best signal control strategy for an arterial corridor similar to the one under analysis.},

Furthermore, recent extension of the first-order model to multiclass traffic dynamics has revealed some interesting non-linear traffic phenomena such as hysteresis and capacity drop. However, most of the existing first-order continuum models do not display the widely scattered flow-density relationship. We argue in this article that the widely scattered flow-density relationship might be caused by the random variations in driving behaviour. It is shown that both of the hysteresis transitions and the wide scattering can be reproduced by a multiclass first-order model with a stochastic setting in the model parameters. The simulation results support our findings and are in good agreement with the real data.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to detection and tracking of moving objects with a 2D laser scanner for autonomous driving applications. Objects are modelled with a set of rigidly attached sample points along their boundaries whose positions are initialised with and updated by raw laser measurements, thus allowing a nonparametric representation that is capable of representing objects independent of their classes and shapes. Detection and tracking of such object models are handled in a theoretically principled manner as a Bayes filter where the motion states and shape information of all objects are represented as a part of a joint state which includes in addition the pose of the sensor and geometry of the static part of the world. We derive the prediction and observation models for the evolution of the joint state, and describe how the knowledge of the static local background helps identifying dynamic objects from static ones in a principled and straightforward way. Dealing with raw laser points poses a significant challenge to data association. We propose a hierarchical approach, and present a new variant of the well-known Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) algorithm to respect and take advantage of the constraints of the problem introduced through correlations between observations. Finally, we calibrate the system systematically on real world data containing 7.5K labelled object examples and validate on 6K test cases. We demonstrate its performance over an existing industry standard targeted at the same problem domain as well as a classical approach to model-free object tracking.},

This paper advocates that for robotics applications, which often involve mission-critical decision making, good performance according to these standard metrics is desirable but insufficient to appropriately characterise system performance. We introduce and motivate the importance of a classifier's introspective capacity: the ability to mitigate potentially overconfident classifications by an appropriate assessment of how qualified the system is to make a judgement on the current test datum. We provide an intuition as to how this introspective capacity can be achieved and systematically investigate it in a selection of classification frameworks commonly used in robotics: support vector machines, LogitBoost classifiers and Gaussian Process classifiers (GPCs). Our experiments demonstrate that for common robotics tasks a framework such as a GPC exhibits a superior introspective capacity while maintaining commensurate classification performance to more popular, alternative approaches.},

abstract = {This paper describes the obstacle detection and tracking algorithms developed for Boss, which is Carnegie Mellon University 's winning entry in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. We describe the tracking subsystem and show how it functions in the context of the larger perception system. The tracking subsystem gives the robot the ability to understand complex scenarios of urban driving to safely operate in the proximity of other vehicles. The tracking system fuses sensor data from more than a dozen sensors with additional information about the environment to generate a coherent situational model. A novel multiple-model approach is used to track the objects based on the quality of the sensor data. Finally, the architecture of the tracking subsystem explicitly abstracts each of the levels of processing. The subsystem can easily be extended by adding new sensors and validation algorithms.},

@article{Dresner2007a,
abstract = {In modern urban settings, automobile traffic and collisions lead to endless frustration as well as significant loss of life, property, and productivity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest that autonomous vehicle navigation may soon be a reality. It has been demonstrated that a reservation-based approach can efficiently and safely govern interactions of multiple autonomous vehicles at intersections. Such an approach alleviates many traditional problems associated with intersections, in terms of both safety and efficiency. However, the system relies on all vehicles being equipped with the requisite technology — a restriction that would make implementing such a system in the real world extremely difficult. In this paper, we extend the previously proposed system to allow for incremental deployability. The modified system is able to accomodate traditional human-operated vehicles using existing infrastructure. Furthermore, we show that as the number of autonomous vehicles on the road increases, traffic delays decrease monotonically toward the levels exhibited in the previous work. Finally, we develop a method for switching between various human-usable configurations while the system is running, in order to facilitate an even smoother transition. The work is fully implemented and tested in our custom simulator, and we present detailed experimental results attesting to its effectiveness.},

However, for most people, the personal automobile has now become their initial exposure to new intelligent computational technologies such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, adaptive computing, voice recognition and others. In this chapter we will discuss the various intelligent vehicle systems that are now being deployed into motor vehicles. These intelligent system applications impact every facet of the driver experience and improve both vehicle safety and performance. We will also describe recent developments in autonomous vehicle design and demonstrate that this type of technology is not that far away from deployment. Other applications of intelligent system design apply to adapting the vehicle to the driver's preferences and helping the driver stay aware. The automobile industry is very competitive and there are many other new advances in vehicle technology that cannot be discussed yet. However, this chapter provides an introduction into those technologies that have already been announced or deployed and shows how the automobile has evolved from a basic transportation device into an advanced vehicle with a host of on-board computational technologies.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the response of a vehicle in a stream of traffic to the behaviour of its predecessor is important in estimating what effect changes to the driving environment will have on traffic flow. Various proposed to explain this behaviour have different strengths and weaknesses. The paper constructs a new model for the response of the following vehicle based on the assumption that each driver sets limits to his desired braking and acceleration rates. The parameters in the model correspond directly to obvious characteristics of driver behaviour and the paper goes on to show that when realistic values are assigned to the parameters in a simulation, the model reproduces the characteristics of real traffic flow. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {This paper is about long-term navigation in environments whose appearance changes over time - suddenly or gradually. We describe, implement and validate an approach which allows us to incrementally learn a model whose complexity varies naturally in accordance with variation of scene appearance. It allows us to leverage the state of the art in pose estimation to build over many runs, a world model of sufficient richness to allow simple localisation despite a large variation in conditions. As our robot repeatedly traverses its workspace, it accumulates distinct visual experiences that in concert, implicitly represent the scene variation - each experience captures a visual mode. When operating in a previously visited area, we continually try to localise in these previous experiences while simultaneously running an independent vision based pose estimation system. Failure to localise in a sufficient number of prior experiences indicates an insufficient model of the workspace and instigates the laying down of the live image sequence as a new distinct experience. In this way, over time we can capture the typical time varying appearance of an environment and the number of experiences required tends to a constant. Although we focus on vision as a primary sensor throughout, the ideas we present here are equally applicable to other sensor modalities. We demonstrate our approach working on a road vehicle operating over a three month period at different times of day, in different weather and lighting conditions. In all, we process over 136,000 frames captured from 37km of driving. View full abstract},

abstract = {We present a method for identifying drivable surfaces in difficult unpaved and offroad terrain conditions as encountered in the DARPA Grand Challenge robot race. Instead of relying on a static, pre-computed road appearance model, this method adjusts its model to changing environments. It achieves robustness by combining sensor information from a laser range finder, a pose estimation system and a color camera. Using the first two modalities, the system first identifies a nearby patch of drivable surface. Computer Vision then takes this patch and uses it to construct appearance models to find drivable surface outward into the far range. This information is put into a drivability map for the vehicle path planner. In addition to evaluating the methods performance using a scoring framework run on real-world data, the system was entered, and won, the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Post-race log-file analysis proved that without the Computer Vision algorithm, the vehicle would not have driven fast enough to win.},

abstract = {Intelligent vehicles are an application in which the words “intelligent autonomous systems” represent not only an important research topic but also a strategic solution to the mobility problems that may arise in the coming years. Vehicles that can move autonomously and navigate in everyday traffic, on highways, and in urban and unstructured scenarios will become a reality in the next few decades. Besides the obvious advantages of increasing road safety and improving the quality and efficiency of moving people and goods around, the integration of intelligent features and autonomous functionalities in vehicles will lead to major economic benefits, including reduced fuel consumption, efficient exploitation of the road network and reduced personnel. Furthermore, it is not only the automotive field (public transportation, trucks and automobiles) that is interested in these new technologies, but also other sectors, each with its own target (industrial vehicles, military systems, mission-critical systems and unmanned rescue robots). In this article, the author surveys the major intelligent vehicle projects and activities worldwide, covering not only automotive applications but also special vehicles},

abstract = {We present in this paper a new algorithm for urban traffic light control with mixed traffic (communicating and non communicating vehicles) and mixed infrastructure (equipped and unequipped junctions). We call equipped junction here a junction with a traffic light signal (TLS) controlled by a road side unit (RSU). On such a junction, the RSU manifests its connectedness to equipped vehicles by broadcasting its communication address and geographical coordinates. The RSU builds a map of connected vehicles approaching and leaving the junction. The algorithm allows the RSU to select a traffic phase, based on the built map. The selected traffic phase is applied by the TLS; and both equipped and unequipped vehicles must respect it. The traffic management is in feedback on the traffic demand of communicating vehicles. We simulated the vehicular traffic as well as the communications. The two simulations are combined in a closed loop with visualization and monitoring interfaces. Several indicators on vehicular traffic (mean travel time, ended vehicles) and IEEE 802.11p communication performances (end-to-end delay, output rate, throughput, and packet error delivery ratio) are derived and illustrated in three dimension maps. We then extended the traffic control to a urban road network where we also varied the number of equipped junctions. Other indicators are shown for traffic and communication performances in the case of a road network control where high gains are experienced in the simulation results.},

abstract = {Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) is the extraction of vehicle license plate information from an image or a sequence of images. The extracted information can be used with or without a database in many applications, such as electronic payment systems (toll payment, parking fee payment), and freeway and arterial monitoring systems for traffic surveillance. The ALPR uses either a color, black and white, or infrared camera to take images. The quality of the acquired images is a major factor in the success of the ALPR. ALPR as a real-life application has to quickly and successfully process license plates under different environmental conditions, such as indoors, outdoors, day or night time. It should also be generalized to process license plates from different nations, provinces, or states. These plates usually contain different colors, are written in different languages, and use different fonts; some plates may have a single color background and others have background images. The license plates can be partially occluded by dirt, lighting, and towing accessories on the car. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques for ALPR. We categorize different ALPR techniques according to the features they used for each stage, and compare them in terms of pros, cons, recognition accuracy, and processing speed. Future forecasts of ALPR are given at the end.},

abstract = {This report estimates the frequency of different crash types that would potentially be addressed by various categories of Intelligent Transportation Systems as part of the IntelliDrive SM safety systems program. Crash types include light-vehicle crashes involving at least one light vehicle with gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less, heavy-truck crashes involving at least one heavy truck with GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, and crashes involving all vehicle types. Crash frequency estimates are based on samples of police-reported crashes from the 2005-2008 General Estimates System crash databases. System categories encompass vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication systems, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative systems, and combination of V2V and V2I systems. The frequency of target crashes is derived from pre-crash scenarios described in police-reported crashes involving unimpaired drivers. V2V systems potentially address 79 percent of all vehicle target crashes, 81 percent of all light-vehicle target crashes, and 71 percent of all heavy-truck target crashes. V2I systems potentially deal with 26 percent all vehicle target crashes, 27 percent of all light-vehicle target crashes, and 15 percent of all heavy-truck target crashes. Combined V2V and V2I systems potentially address 81 percent all vehicle target crashes, 83 percent of all light-vehicle target crashes, and 72 percent of all heavy-truck target crashes.},

abstract = {Future requirements for drastic reduction of CO2 production and energy$\backslash$nconsumption will lead to significant changes in the way we see mobility$\backslash$nin the years to come. However, the automotive industry has identified$\backslash$nsignificant barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles, including$\backslash$nreduced driving range and greatly increased refueling times. Automated$\backslash$ncars have the potential to reduce the environmental impact of driving,$\backslash$nand increase the safety of motor vehicle travel. The current state-of-the-art$\backslash$nin vehicle automation requires a suite of expensive sensors. While$\backslash$nthe cost of these sensors is decreasing, integrating them into electric$\backslash$ncars will increase the price and represent another barrier to adoption.$\backslash$nThe V-Charge Project, funded by the European Commission, seeks to$\backslash$naddress these problems simultaneously by developing an electric automated$\backslash$ncar, outfitted with close-to-market sensors, which is able to automate$\backslash$nvalet parking and recharging for integration into a future transportation$\backslash$nsystem. The final goal is the demonstration of a fully operational$\backslash$nsystem including automated navigation and parking. This paper presents$\backslash$nan overview of the V-Charge system, from the platform setup to the$\backslash$nmapping, perception, and planning sub-systems.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {In animal societies as well as in human crowds, many observed collective behaviours result from self-organized processes based on local interactions among individuals. However, models of crowd dynamics are still lacking a systematic individual-level experimental verification, and the local mechanisms underlying the formation of collective patterns are not yet known in detail. We have conducted a set of well-controlled experiments with pedestrians performing simple avoidance tasks in order to determine the laws ruling their behaviour during interactions. The analysis of the large trajectory dataset was used to compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction and speed of a pedestrian for various interaction distances and angles. The experimental results reveal features of the decision process when pedestrians choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model based on the above findings were then compared with bidirectional flows of people recorded in a crowded street. Simulations generate two asymmetric lanes with opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our empirical observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step ahead in the understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and allows for reliable predictions of collective pedestrian movements under natural conditions.},

abstract = {The linear stability properties of car-following models of highway traffic are analysed. A general family of models is introduced and the subsequent analysis developed in terms of its partial derivatives. Two measures of wave propagation, namely (i) the group velocity and (ii) the signal velocity, are introduced and computed. These measures are used to classify how instability propagates disturbances, measured relative to the frame of the road along which the vehicles drive. Detector data suggest that disturbances should propagate only in an upstream direction (convective upstream instability), and it is shown how to parametrize models to agree with data and avoid unrealistic downstream propagation (absolute and convective downstream instability).},

abstract = {This paper develops, implements and tests a framework for driving behavior modeling that integrates the various decisions, such as acceleration, lane changing and gap acceptance. Furthermore, the proposed framework is based on the concepts of short-term goal and short-term plan. Drivers are assumed to conceive and perform short-term plans in order to accomplish short-term goals. This behavioral framework supports a more realistic representation of the driving task, since it captures drivers' planning capabilities and allows decisions to be based on anticipated future conditions. An integrated driving behavior model, which utilizes these concepts, is developed. The model captures both lane changing and acceleration behaviors. The driver's short-term goal is defined by the target lane. Drivers who wish to change lanes but cannot change lanes immediately, select a short-term plan to perform the desired lane change. Short-term plans are defined by the various gaps in traffic in the target lane. Drivers adapt their acceleration behavior to facilitate the lane change using the target gap. Hence, inter-dependencies between lane changing and acceleration behaviors are captured.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Humans need to solve computationally intractable problems such as visual search, categorization, and simultaneous learning and acting, yet an increasing body of evidence suggests that their solutions to instantiations of these problems are near optimal. Computational complexity advances an explanation to this apparent paradox: (1) only a small portion of instances of such problems are actually hard, and (2) successful heuristics exploit structural properties of the typical instance to selectively improve parts that are likely to be sub-optimal. We hypothesize that these two ideas largely account for the good performance of humans on computationally hard problems. We tested part of this hypothesis by studying the solutions of 28 participants to 28 instances of the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Participants were provided feedback on the cost of their solutions and were allowed unlimited solution attempts (trials). We found a significant improvement between the first and last trials and that solutions are significantly different from random tours that follow the convex hull and do not have self-crossings. More importantly, we found that participants modified their current better solutions in such a way that edges belonging to the optimal solution (“good” edges) were significantly more likely to stay than other edges (“bad” edges), a hallmark of structural exploitation. We found, however, that more trials harmed the participants' ability to tell good from bad edges, suggesting that after too many trials the participants “ran out of ideas.” In sum, we provide the first demonstration of significant performance improvement on the TSP under repetition and feedback and evidence that human problem-solving may exploit the structure of hard problems paralleling behavior of state-of-the-art heuristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Optimal switching of traffic lights on a network of junctions is a computationally intractable problem. In this research, road traffic networks containing signallized junctions are simulated. A computer game interface is used to enable a human {\{}$\backslash$textquoteleft{\}}player{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} to control the traffic light settings on the junctions within the simulation. A supervised learning approach, based on simple neural network classifiers can be used to capture human player{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s strategies in the game and thus develop a human-trained machine control (HuTMaC) system that approaches human levels of performance. Experiments conducted within the simulation compare the performance of HuTMaC to two well-established traffic-responsive control systems that are widely deployed in the developed world and also to a temporal difference learning-based control method. In all experiments, HuTMaC outperforms the other control methods in terms of average delay and variance over delay. The conclusion is that these results add weight to the suggestion that HuTMaC may be a viable alternative, or supplemental method, to approximate optimization for some practical engineering control problems where the optimal strategy is computationally intractable.},

abstract = {— This paper is about life-long vast-scale localisation in spite of changes in weather, lighting and scene structure. Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Naviga-tion [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an envi-ronment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experi-ences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations – which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited compu-tational resources. We demonstrate and evaluate our system over three challenging datasets, totalling 206km of outdoor travel. We demonstrate the system in a diverse range of lighting and weather conditions, scene clutter, camera occlusions, and permanent structural change in the environment.},

abstract = {In this commentary, it is argued that the car following models discussed in Brackstone, M., and McDonald, M. (Transportation Research - Part F (2000), pp. 181-196) ignore one or more of the following issues that characterize to observed driver behavior. These include: (i) car following is only one of many tasks that drivers perform simultaneously and receives therefore only intermittent attention and control (task scheduling/attention management), (ii) drivers are satisfied with a range of conditions that extend beyond the boundaries imposed by perceptual and control limitation (satisficing instead of optimal performance evaluation), and (iii) in each driving task drivers use a set of highly informative perceptual variables to guide decision making and control (perceptual rather than Newtonian input). To elucidate these issues, a general driver modeling framework is presented in which the car-following task is highlighted (Boer, E. R., {\{}{\&}{\}} Hoedemaeker, M. (1998).

abstract = {Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a new intersection control protocol that exploits the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to control traffic at intersections in a way better than traffic signals and stop signs. A key assumption of this protocol is that vehicles can always follow their trajectories. But mechanical failures can occur in real life, causing vehicles to deviate from their trajectories. A previous approach for handling mechanical failure was to prevent vehicles from entering the intersection after the failure. However, this approach cannot prevent collisions among vehicles already in the intersection or too close to stop because (1) the lack of coordination among vehicles can cause collisions during the execution of evasive actions; and (2) the intersection may not have enough room for evasive actions. In this paper, we propose a preemptive approach that pre-computes evasion plans for several common types of mechanical failures before vehicles enter an intersection. This preemptive approach is necessary because there are situations in which vehicles cannot evade without pre-allocation of space for evasion. We present a modified AIM protocol and demonstrate the effectiveness of evasion plan execution on a miniature autonomous intersection testbed.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Few aspects of modern life inflict as high a cost on society as traffic congestion and automobile accidents. Current work in AI and Intelligent Transportation Systems aims to replace human drivers with autonomous vehicles capable of safely and efficiently navigating through the most hazardous city streets. Once such vehicles are common, interactions between multiple vehicles will be possible. Traffic lights and stop signs, which were designed for human drivers, may no longer be the best method for intersection control. Previously, we made the case for a reservation-based intersection control mechanism designed for autonomous vehicles, but compatible with human drivers. Including human drivers allows incremental deployability as well as support for those who drive for pleasure, but may result in significantly suboptimal performance, as human drivers may be present in dramatically varying proportions. In this paper, we develop a learning-based approach to determine which variant of the control mechanism will be most effective under given conditions, and then combine the resulting predictor with our multiagent intersection management mechanism, enabling it to determine when and how it should alter its configuration to best suit the current traffic conditions. Our extension is fully implemented and tested in simulation, and we provide experimental results demonstrating its efficacy.},

abstract = {In this commentary, it is argued that the car following models discussed in Brackstone, M., and McDonald, M. (Transportation Research - Part F (2000), pp. 181-196) ignore one or more of the following issues that characterize to observed driver behavior. These include: (i) car following is only one of many tasks that drivers perform simultaneously and receives therefore only intermittent attention and control (task scheduling/attention management), (ii) drivers are satisfied with a range of conditions that extend beyond the boundaries imposed by perceptual and control limitation (satisficing instead of optimal performance evaluation), and (iii) in each driving task drivers use a set of highly informative perceptual variables to guide decision making and control (perceptual rather than Newtonian input). To elucidate these issues, a general driver modeling framework is presented in which the car-following task is highlighted (Boer, E. R., {\&} Hoedemaeker, M. (1998).

In this paper, we proposed a framework of ACC strategy based on the four longitudinal driving modes of the Wiedemann psychophysical model (i.e.,free driving, approaching, following, and emergency). In order to improve user acceptance, the expectations of an ACC user in each mode were discussed and the control strategy of each mode was designed accordingly. Finally, the effect of mixing ACC vehicles with manually driven vehicles was explored in VIS SIM. The results showed that, with the increase of market penetration of ACC vehicles, the average time of delay and average times of stops, as well as the length of queue, were reduced notably and the traffic flow was improved to a great extent, especially when the traffic flow was saturated.},

abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks—in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

The author introduces the gap-acceptance model to describe the lane-changing processes, particularly at entries. That is, a vehicle is able to change to the target lane when both the lead-gap and the lag-gap are accepted. The author developed a suitable numerical solution for general macroscopic continuum models, analyzed the mathematical properties of the newly developed model, and presented some interesting results in the calibration and validation process of the model. The author demonstrated mathematically that the geometrical design of the roadway plays an important role in the traffic operations on freeways and in urban networks. Concluding the thesis are four appendices: the formulation for lane-changing probabilities, a linear stability analysis of the developed model, HELENA traffic flow network model, and the MATLAB-based Nelder-Mead algorithm.},

abstract = {Many large cities have, or plan to have, urban traffic control (utc) systems that centrally monitor and control the traffic signals in their jurisdiction. The present generation of utc systems usually co-ordinates the signals on fixed-time plans, which consist of sets of timings that determine when each signal turns red and green. The plans are precalculated to suit average conditions during each part off the day (e.g. A.M. peak) and do not respond to variations in flows in the network. Since 1973 the UK Transport and Road Research Laboratory has been researching a vehicle responsive method of signal control called SCOOT (split, cycle and offset optimisation technique). Research was carried out in Glasgow by a small team from TRRL and the Ferranti, GEC and Plessey traffic companies, with assistance from Strathclyde Regional Council. In 1976 the success of the research phase led to a development project between the departments of transport and of industry and the three traffic companies. TRRL continued research into SCOOT and in 1979 carried out a full-scale trial of SCOOT in Glasgow. As part of the development project, and with the co-operation of West Midlands County Council, SCOOT was installed in Coventry. A further full-scale trial of the developed system was carried out in 1980. This paper describes the SCOOT system and the results of the trials which compared SCOOT with up-to-date fixed-time systems. It is concluded that SCOOT reduced vehicle delay by an average of about 12 percent during the working day. The surveys demonstrate that scoot rapidly adapts to unusual traffic conditions as well as to the usual variations in demand that occur throughout the day and night. It is an important benefit of SCOOT that there is no need to periodically prepare new fixed-time plans and that the signal timings are automatically kept up-to-date. The traffic model in SCOOT provides real-time information on flows and queues and is likely to be a key element in the development of new traffic management strategies that make the best overall use of roads in urban areas. This paper is a shortened version of TRRL Report LR 1014 (see TRIS 348845). This paper was presented at the IEE's Conference on Road Traffic signalling, Londong, March 1982.

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to learning robot terrain assessment from human demonstration. An operator drives a robot for a short period of time, supervising the gathering of traversable and untraversable terrain data. After this initial training period, the robot can then predict the traversability of new terrain based on its experiences. We improve on current methods in two ways: first, we maintain a richer (higher-dimensional) representation of the terrain that is better able to distinguish between different training examples. Second, we use a Gaussian-process classifier for terrain assessment due to its superior introspective abilities (leading to better uncertainty estimates) when compared to other classifier methods in the literature. Our method is tested on real data and shown to outperform current methods both in classification accuracy and uncertainty estimation.},

abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of segmenting things that could move from 3D laser scans of urban scenes. In particular, we wish to detect instances of classes of interest in autonomous driving applications - cars, pedestrians and bicyclists - amongst significant background clutter. Our aim is to provide the layout of an end-to-end pipeline which, when fed by a raw stream of 3D data, produces distinct groups of points which can be fed to downstream classifiers for categorisation. We postulate that, for the specific classes considered in this work, solving a binary classification task (i.e. separating the data into foreground and background first) outperforms approaches that tackle the multi-class problem di- rectly. This is confirmed using custom and third-party datasets gathered of urban street scenes. While our system is agnostic to the specific clustering algorithm deployed we explore the use of a Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree for an end-to- end segmentation pipeline and devise a RANSAC-based edge selection criterion.

This process involves developing a framework for evaluating a car- following model and comparing the behavior predicted by the GM models with the behavior observed under the real world situation. For this purpose, an instrumented vehicle was used to collect data on the headway and speeds of two consecutive vehicles under actual traffic conditions. Shortcomings of the existing GM based models are identified, in particular, the stability conditions were analyzed in detail. A fuzzy-inference based model of car-following is developed to represent the approximate nature of stimulus-response process during driving. This model is evaluated using the same evaluation framework used for the GM models and the data obtained by the instrumented test vehicle. Comparison between the performance of the two models show that the proposed fuzzy inference model can overcome many shortcomings of the GM based car-following models, and can be useful for developing the algorithm for the adaptive cruise control for automated highway system(AHS).

abstract = {We generalize a wide class of time-continuous microscopic traffic models to include essential aspects of driver behaviour not captured by these models. Specifically, we consider (i) finite reaction times, (ii) estimation errors, (iii) looking several vehicles ahead (spatial anticipation), and (iv) temporal anticipation. The estimation errors are modelled as stochastic Wiener processes and lead to time-correlated fluctuations of the acceleration. We show that the destabilizing effects of reaction times and estimation errors can essentially be compensated for by spatial and temporal anticipation, that is, the combination of stabilizing and destabilizing effects results in the same qualitative macroscopic dynamics as that of the, respectively, underlying simple car-following model. In many cases, this justifies the use of simplified, physics-oriented models with a few parameters only. Although the qualitative dynamics is unchanged, multi-anticipation increase both spatial and temporal scales of stop-and-go waves and other complex patterns of congested traffic in agreement with real traffic data. Remarkably, the anticipation allows accident-free smooth driving in complex traffic situations even if reaction times exceed typical time headways.},

We, however, anticipate there will be a long transition period during which most vehicles have some but not all capabilities of fully autonomous vehicles. This paper introduces a new protocol called Semi-Autonomous Intersection Management, which allows vehicles with partially-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control to enter an intersection from different directions simultaneously. Our experiments show that this protocol can greatly decrease traffic delay when most vehicles are semi-autonomous. Our incremental deployment study reveals that traffic delay keeps decreasing as more and more vehicles employ features of autonomy.},

abstract = {Wireless magnetic sensor networks offer a very attractive, low-cost alternative to inductive loops for traffic measurement in freeways and at intersections. In addition to vehicle count, occupancy and speed, the sensors yield traffic information (such as vehicle classification) that cannot be obtained from loop data. Because such networks can be deployed in a very short time, they can also be used (and reused) for temporary traffic measurement. This paper reports the detection capabilities of magnetic sensors, based on two field experiments. The first experiment collected a two-hour trace of measurements on Hearst Avenue in Berkeley. The vehicle detection rate is better than 99 percent (100 percent for vehicles other than motorcycles); and estimates of vehicle length and speed appear to be better than 90 percent. Moreover, the measurements also give inter-vehicle spacing or headways, which reveal such interesting phenomena as platoon formation downstream of a traffic signal. Results of the second experiment are preliminary. Sensor data from 37 passing vehicles at the same site are processed and classified into 6 types. Sixty percent of the vehicles are classified correctly, when length is not used as a feature. The classification algorithm can be implemented in real time by the sensor node itself, in contrast to other methods based on high scan-rate inductive loop signals, which require extensive offline computation. We believe that when length is used as a feature, 80-90 percent of vehicles will be correctly classified.   },

abstract = {The objective of this project was to develop and evaluate new traffic signal control algorithms using the new data made available in an IntelliDrive SM environment. The project was organized into five tasks: • Task 1: Investigation of the IntelliDrive SM Data Sources: This task investigated the potential data sources available in an IntelliDrive SM environment, and the potential and limitation of those sources. Two data elements were identified that are beneficial to signalized intersection operations, but are not included in the SAE J2735 DSRC Message Set Dictionary: number of passengers and real-time delay. The results of this investigation are included in Task 1: Report on the Investigation of IntelliDrive SM Data Sources. • Task 2: Development of New Traffic Signal Control Algorithms under IntelliDrive SM : This task proposed three traffic control strategies using IntelliDrive SM data as the primary data source. The three algorithms were: oversaturated conditions, vehicle clustering, and predictive microscopic. Task 2: Development of New Traffic Signal Control Algorithms under IntelliDrive SM provides more information on the developed algorithms. • Task 3: Development of Tools for Generating Arterial MOEs from IntelliDrive SM : This task investigated the effect that IntelliDrive SM data would have on the collection of signalized intersection measures-of-effectiveness (MOEs), and proposed new performance metrics. The new metrics included person delay, sudden decelerations, changes in lateral acceleration, network connectivity, aggregate regulation compliance, driver behavior modeling, and weather/light conditions. The results of this task are included in Task 3: Report on Measures of Effectiveness and their Collection in the Simulated IntelliDrive SM Environment. • Task 4: Evaluation of the Developed Traffic Signal Control Algorithms: This task evaluated the traffic signal control algorithms developed in Task 2 on a virtual IntelliDrive SM test bed, at a range of levels of vehicle connectivity. The algorithms showed a significant improvement over coordinated-actuated signal control, with between 6{\%} and 28{\%} reductions in delay. All three algorithms began to experience benefits at 25{\%} market penetration. More results are provided in Task 4: Report on Evaluation Results of Traffic Signal Control Algorithms in the Simulated IntelliDrive},

abstract = {The idea of using Bluetooth technology to obtain vehicle speed data 
is currently in the early stages of development. Recently, much work
has been done to refine the data collection methodology and to verify
its validity. However, little has been done to develop a data
cleaning methodology for the Bluetooth vehicle speed data beyond
visual inspection of the data set. A data cleaning methodology was
developed in this study based on a time series approach. The
collected Bluetooth vehicle speed data were modeled using an ARIMA
model to determine what speeds should be expected based on preceding
data points. In order to meet the fundamental requirements of the
time series modeling procedure, the data must be evenly spaced in
time prior to modeling. While the nature of traffic data does not
lend itself to being naturally evenly sampled, the data can be
grouped in order to create an evenly sampled time series. In this
study, several time groupings were considered and it was determined
that using the median value of a 30 second time group produced the
best initial model fit. The residual values were then evaluated using
common statistical outlier detection tests, such as the Modified
Z-Test, Grubbs{\&}{\#}8217; Test and Chauvenet{\&}{\#}8217;s Criterion, to
determine how much each data point differs from the expected value.
The number of outliers detected by each method was compared, and it
was determined that the Modified Z-Test detects the most outliers.
Once all outliers were removed from the data set, the initial ARIMA
model was applied in order to create a direct comparison between the
original time series and the outlier-free time series. It was
determined that using the Modified Z-Test to detect outliers provides
the most improvements in model fit.},

@article{Silver2016,
abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple representation of traffic on a highway with a single entrance and exit. The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.},

@article{Nantes2015,
abstract = {In recent years, rapid advances in information technology have led to various data collection systems which are enriching the sources of empirical data for use in transport systems. Currently, traffic data are collected through various sensors including loop detectors, probe vehicles, cell-phones, Bluetooth, video cameras, remote sensing and public transport smart cards. It has been argued that combining the complementary information from multiple sources will generally result in better accuracy, increased robustness and reduced ambiguity. Despite the fact that there have been substantial advances in data assimilation techniques to reconstruct and predict the traffic state from multiple data sources, such methods are generally data-driven and do not fully utilize the power of traffic models. Furthermore, the existing methods are still limited to freeway networks and are not yet applicable in the urban context due to the enhanced complexity of the flow behavior. The main traffic phenomena on urban links are generally caused by the boundary conditions at intersections, un-signalized or signalized, at which the switching of the traffic lights and the turning maneuvers of the road users lead to shock-wave phenomena that propagate upstream of the intersections. This paper develops a new model-based methodology to build up a real-time traffic prediction model for arterial corridors using data from multiple sources, particularly from loop detectors and partial observations from Bluetooth and GPS devices.},
